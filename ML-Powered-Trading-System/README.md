# Regime Adaptive Trading System

An institutional-grade ML-powered trading system with automatic regime detection, adaptive strategy selection, and seamless transition between paper and live trading.

## Overview

This trading system is designed with enterprise-level architecture principles to provide a robust platform for algorithmic trading across different market regimes. The system leverages machine learning for market regime detection, strategy optimization, and portfolio management, with a strong focus on risk management and system resilience.

## Key Features

- **Regime Detection & Adaptation**: Automatically identifies market regimes and adapts strategies accordingly
- **Seamless Mode Switching**: Zero-downtime transition between paper and live trading
- **ML-Powered Alpha Generation**: Advanced machine learning models for signal generation
- **Comprehensive Risk Controls**: Multi-level risk management with explicit limits and circuit breakers
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Sophisticated portfolio construction with risk constraints
- **High Performance Architecture**: Designed for low-latency trading with explicit performance budgets
- **Extensive Monitoring**: Real-time dashboards and performance analytics
- **Disaster Recovery**: Enterprise-grade reliability with transactional state management
- **Online Learning**: Continuous model improvement with proper validation safeguards

## Core Architecture Principles

- **Modularity with Clear Boundaries**: Components with well-defined interfaces and responsibilities
- **Single Source of Truth**: One authoritative source for each type of data
- **Strict Performance Budget**: Explicit latency and resource constraints for all components
- **Stateless Where Possible**: Minimizing state-dependent components for greater reliability
- **Fault Isolation**: Preventing failure cascades across system components
- **Observable System**: Comprehensive metrics and logs for all critical paths
- **Deterministic Behavior**: Consistent system responses given the same inputs
- **Online Learning**: Continuous improvement through proper feedback loops
